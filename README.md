- 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo. I'm currently learning how to code in my freetime.  
- 👀 I’m interested both data and physical sciences. I recently ended a very brief, yet successful, experience playing online poker. 
          It was a diverting introduction to new ideas such as game theory, accounting concepts (e.g., "equity" and "EV"), and risks/rewards calculations. 
          I also enjoy working out, volunteering, and playing guitar. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about data science in my freetime; specifically Bayesian mechanism design. 
          I am familiar with excel, but am currently trying to learn R  and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow beginners as a way to both hold ourselves accountable and make our mutual endeavor much more enjoyable. 
          I'm equally open to learn from anyone with experience as well.
